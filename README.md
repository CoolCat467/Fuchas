## Advantages
Using the the hardware abstraction layer that abstracts hardware to common API. You can develop easily applications that supports multiple hardwares, without directly having to support them.

And for the end user, he benefits of the freedom to install any interfaces he wants, to easily install/desinstall programs. And as OPPM replacement, Fuchas offers an integrated alternative: fpm. And of course Fuchas offers directories/files attributes and a security system (WIP)

## Comparisons
In term of startup speed, there isn't better for what all of Fuchas is capable. Multitasking usable on slow machines. And fast interfaces! Say goodbye to the slowness, and enter Fuchas! Videos coming out soon. Fuchas is also only 150KiB, that means you could put it 3 times in a floppy!

## Miscelanous

It is also an OS containing a lot of libraries inside it for developer usage, which is permitted by its low base size (the OS is only 150KiB). For example, it contains liburf, a reader + writer of uncompressed URF archives

Default admin account (only on test environment, not made on installation) is: admin, admin
